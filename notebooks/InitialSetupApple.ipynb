    "\n",
    "A terminal, also known as a command line interface (CLI), is a text-based interface used to interact with your computer. Unlike graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that use windows, buttons, and icons, a terminal allows users to execute commands by typing them out and receiving text feedback. This interface is powerful for running programs, managing system tasks, and accessing a direct line to the operating system's underlying functionalities."
